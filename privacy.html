    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 16, 2026</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy describes how Whoop Personal Analytics ("the Application") handles data 
        accessed through the Whoop API. This is a personal data analysis tool developed and used 
        solely by a single individual for personal health analytics and statistical research purposes.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Key Point:</strong> This is a local, personal-use application. Your Whoop data is 
        accessed only by you, for your own analysis, and remains on your local machine.
    </div>

    <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application accesses the following data from your Whoop account via the official Whoop API:</p>

        <li><strong>Cycle data:</strong> Daily strain, average heart rate during cycles</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
